* the art of hacking

This page is an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode document]] and tells the story of my journey in to professional computing.

Here's me, just married 9/19/2020 A.D. --- during the apocalypse

** In the beginning...

[[./assets/images/220px-Ibm_px_xt_color.jpg]]

My first computer was one of these, pre-loaded by dad with a boat load of cracked games, such as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT6bVDxOs3k]["Hopper."]]

This box was the mystery of my childhood-- I knew it had potential to do really cool things, if only I could connect to the internet.

There was always some odd file that I would find on the system and then I would try to figure out if it was a program that I could execute.

I learned DOS commands and batch scripts early on in this way, before GUI's were much of a thing.

I was running my own WAMP stacks and messing around with frameworks like "Php Nuke", "PhpBB" and exploring Geocities in Junior High. This was all mostly to make cool websites for my video game "clans."

** diy ethics and unix philosophy

#+END_QUOTE

I graduated High School in 2006.
I was homeschooled before it was the cool thing to do. [fn:e] My parents were very forward-thinking in this regard.

My father taught me that if you want something done right, then you need to do it yourself.

This comes in to play later on when I realized out that I could learn anything I wanted on the internet--
that the original hacker spirit is the Unix Philosophy [fn:a] with DIY ethos. [fn:b]

** social engineering: from hacking people to hacking machines

~Social Engineering: (in the context of information security) the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes.~

#+END_QUOTE

I dropped out of college early on, not having a high regard for the system [fn:c] at the time.
I traveled and read a lot of books on Philosophy, History, Theology and English -- as any millennial should.

I landed in Honolulu, Hawaii.
There I worked as a Valet Driver, Bellman, Doorman in some of the nicest Hotels and Restaurants on the Waikiki strip.

[[./assets/images/waikiki.jpg]]

A few years back I found a random photograph of myself by googling one of my hotel names.

While not malevolent-- little did I know at the time-- that I was receiving a free education in social engineering.
The name of the game was called "Did he (/or she/) tip you?" and we knew how to get tipped-- unwittingly by hacking people.
Like any good flick on HBO Max, the illusion was wealth and the key was social discourse.
These skills would be invaluable later while working in tech as a white hat.

In this way, I have always been a "hacker."

** hacking: not a bad thing, a fun thing!

What does hacking and work in the service industry have in common? Playful cleverness.
In "Did he (/or she/) tip you 101, one quickly learns that to get tips, you have to have fun with your guests.

Similarly put by an O.G. hacker,

I went to lunch with some GNU fans, and was sitting down to eat some tteokbokki (*), when a waitress set down six chopsticks right in front of me.
It occurred to me that perhaps these were meant for three people, but it was more amusing to imagine that I was supposed to use all six.
I did not know any way to do that, so I realized that if I could come up with a way, it would be a hack. I started thinking. After a few seconds I had an idea.

First I used my left hand to put three chopsticks into my right hand.
That was not so hard, though I had to figure out where to put them so that I could control them individually. Then I used my right hand to put the other three chopsticks into my left hand. That was hard, since I had to keep the three chopsticks already in my right hand from falling out. After a couple of tries I got it done.

** Blade Runner IRL

One day I looked up from my hotel with my Bellman standing next to me, and we noticed the glint of a scope from a far-off hotel room flashing at us.

Somebody was watching us. Nothing ever came of it, but we found it very odd at the time.

Also around that time Snowden [fn:g] was revealing to the citizens of the United States that the government was illegally spying on all of us.

Since I always had a natural /aptitude/ for computing-- after all my first Linux distro was Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron ~2008--
I found all this was very interesting to think about.
When Snowden revealed that smartphones were backdoored by the NSA, among other things, it reignited something in me.

Around this time I found renewed joy in computing, and the cypher-punk feels of Linux. In those days one would have found me growing out my neckbeard whilst reverse SSH tunneling 10 servers deep before connecting to the
TOR network (and every other privacy-centric network I could find.)
I soon joined various IRC channels, where we would discuss merits of various Linux distros and open-source software for hours.
It was just a hobby at first-- that is, privacy and security research-- I hadn't the slightest where this would all lead.

I soon found myself moving back to Oregon, where I was born raised. I told my parents at the time, "There's something good here, I'm learning a lot.
I will be doing this for a living soon enough, but there's a lot to learn first..."

I started watching [[https://www.youtube.com/c/BryanLunduke/videos][The Lunduke Show]]. I went to /YouTube University/, catching every [[https://www.youtube.com/c/tutoriaLinux/videos][TutoriaLinux (Dave Cohen)]] episode I could --
I sent him a thank you Email years later along the lines, "Hey, thanks for sharing your knowledge and helping me to get grounded in the industry." He replied back, too.
Dave's a champ in my book.

** white hats: seriously, hackers aren't all bad

white hat: a person who hacks into a computer network in order to test or evaluate its security systems.

~"While security dudes tend to speak in terms of black or white hats, it seems to me that nearly all hats are in varying shades of grey."~

As opposed to "black hat,"

black hat: a person who hacks into a computer network with malicious or criminal intent.

Recruiter note: I like to think of myself as one of the good guys!

Now Google famously had a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil]["Don't be evil"]] Code of Conduct. [fn:d] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaTKaHKCAFg][And I would that they still did...]] I digress...

** Want to join a tech cult?

Like any good cult, I found that tech has its own jargon and can give you sense of identity,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Did you even google it? RTFM dude...
#+END_QUOTE

There are even holy wars in tech, see Vim vs. Emacs [fn:h]

I started COOSLUG (**Coos** Bay, Oregon) **L** inux **U** ser **G** roup with my buddy [[https://github.com/bayprogrammer][Zeb DeOs]], the only other Hacker I knew in the area. He's a prominent full stack developer
and I owe this guy everything career-wise.

In a world where things are so often out of our control, the fact that we can program computers do exactly what we want is a strange comfort, and we shared this in common.

https://github.com/cooslug

We met once a month or so and ordered pizza, with prolonged Emacs hacking sessions and candid discussions on the state of the industry, jobs and
open source software.

** The bootcamp years and imposter syndrome

Imposter Syndrome is a funny thing. It's like you know, "I'm good enough to be here and do this job." But you don't feel that way on the inside.

I suspect it stems from the ever-changing, ever-learning nature of tech.

I recommend you accept that and forget about it. There's nothing wrong with you dude, you're fine!

I spent several years in hell, I mean, I built the place! I don't regret it, but I also don't recommend it.

I was on the computer 12 hours every day, studying. I felt like I had something to prove, and that I needed to be the best before I entered the field full-time
in a paid atmosphere (job.)

During this time I became a Linux distro developer and package maintainer.
I volunteered on Funtoo Linux in the beginning, troubleshooting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Robbins_(computer_programmer)][Daniel Robbins]] new distro.
Drobbins is the creator of Gentoo Linux, you may have heard of it.

I have had numerous mentors who have been invaluable on my learning path,

Zeb of the CoosLug local user group and spreedly.com
Chris Giorgi of #gentoo / #funtoo, awk-programmer extraordinaire on Freenode
Dylanaraps, creator of the pure-bash-bible and the KISS Linux distro
asx, all-around hardware nerd, old school unix hacker at #commanduser on Freenode
