This page tells the story of my journey in professional computing.

I'm a Devops Engineer at [[https://www.immaculatastudios.com/][Immaculata Studios]] where I spend most days automating the AWS world using Docker microservices and Terraform to help my team at scale.

The views here are my own and do necessarily reflect my company's views.

* In the beginning...

[[./assets/images/220px-Ibm_px_xt_color.jpg]]

My first computer was an XT, pre-loaded by dad with a boat load of games, such as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT6bVDxOs3k]["Hopper."]]
I learned DOS commands and batch scripts early on in this way, before GUI's were much of a thing.

I was running my own WAMP stacks and messing around with frameworks like "Php Nuke", "PhpBB" and exploring Geocities in Junior High. This was all mostly to make cool websites for my video game clans. [fn:k]

* A self taught person -- DIY ethics and Unix philosophy

[[./assets/images/Great_Books.jpg]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
~au·to·di·dact: a self-taught person~

/---google/
#+END_QUOTE

I graduated High School in 2006.
I was homeschooled before it was the cool thing to do. [fn:e] My parents were very forward-thinking in this regard.

My father taught me that if you want something done right, then you need to do it yourself.

This comes in to play later on when I realized out that I could learn anything I wanted on the internet--
that the original hacker spirit is the Unix Philosophy [fn:a] with DIY ethos. [fn:b]

* Security and Privacy piques my interest

[[./assets/images/1984.jpg]]

It was around the time when Snowden[fn:g] was blowing the whistle on the government
that I gained a renewed interest in tech.
I always had a natural /aptitude/ for computing-- after all my first Linux distro was Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron ~2008--
but I was doing other things.

I rediscovered Linux and loved all of the cypher-punk feels.
In those days one would have found me growing out my neckbeard whilst reverse SSH tunneling 10 servers deep before connecting to the
TOR network (and every other privacy-centric network I could find.)
I soon joined various IRC channels, where we would discuss merits of various Linux distros and open-source software for hours.
It was just a hobby at first.

I started watching [[https://www.youtube.com/c/BryanLunduke/videos][The Lunduke Show]]. I went to /YouTube University/,
(I know better, to read the docs, now-a-days...),
catching every [[https://www.youtube.com/c/tutoriaLinux/videos][TutoriaLinux (Dave Cohen)]] episode I could --
I sent him a thank you Email years later along the lines,
"Hey, thanks for sharing your knowledge."
He replied back, too. Dave's a champ.

Admittedly, I used to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3iy3wd/stupid_question_what_is_ricing/][rice]] my desktop back then. I used VIM like a pleb[fn:j] and apparently [[https://github.com/a-schaefers/i3-wm-gruvbox-theme][people still like my work in that regard]].

* Want to join a tech cult? There's pizza...

[[./assets/images/tmnt-donatello_small.gif]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Did you even google it? RTFM dude... [fn:i]
#+END_QUOTE

Like any good cult, I have found that tech has its own jargon and can give you sense of identity. There are even holy wars. (See Vim vs. Emacs and Tabs vs. Spaces, as brilliantly demonstrated in the T.V. sitcom Silicon Valley. [fn:h])

I started [[https://github.com/cooslug][COOSLUG]] (*Coos* Bay, Oregon) *L* inux *U* ser *G* roup with my buddy [[https://github.com/bayprogrammer][Zeb DeOs]], the only other Hacker I knew in the area. He's a prominent full stack developer
and I owe this guy everything career-wise.

In a world where things are so often out of our control, the fact that we can program computers do exactly what we want is a strange comfort, and we shared this in common.

We met once a month or so and ordered pizza, with prolonged Emacs hacking sessions and candid discussions on the state of the industry.

* The self-imposed bootcamp years, 2017 -- 2020

[[./assets/images/Linus-Torvalds-quote-about-talking-2a9797.jpg]]

Imposter Syndrome is a funny thing. When you're feeling impostery you know that, /"I'm good enough to be here and do this job."/
-- but you don't feel that way on the inside.
I felt like I had something to prove, and that I needed to be the best before I entered the field full-time in a paid gig.
I suspect it stems from the ever-changing, ever-learning nature of tech.

At the time, I was on the computer 12 hours every day, studying.
I installed Arch Linux a hundred times, I nigh memorized the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide][now infamous wiki]] --
FreeBSD, the same-- and I actually read [[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/][the Handbook.]]
I learned the ins-and-outs of [[https://aws.amazon.com/][AWS]]: ~Route53~, ~S3~, ~EC2~, ~Cloudfront~ and more.
I settled on a text editor, ~emacs~ and started to form my own opinions on things.

I had another mentor during this period of my life, (this was back when ~systemd~ was still a debate), [[https://github.com/TemptorSent][Chris Giorgi]] of #gentoo / #funtoo on Freenode, he was an excellent [[https://www.amazon.com/AWK-Programming-Language-Alfred-Aho/dp/020107981X][awk-programmer]].
He taught me that there are shell scripts and then there are /shell scripts/.

Here's a classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb][fork bomb]],

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
evil () {
  evil|evil &
}
evil
#+END_SRC

Better yet, as we all love good one-liner, ~:(){ :|:& };:~ Now put that in your Terminal and smoke it! I learned POSIX shell script and system administration here in this phase, which leads in to the Devops path now-a-days.

** Free and Open Source Software Experience

[[./assets/images/Free_and_open-source_software_logo_(2009).svg.png]]

*** Documentation writing at Funtoo
During this time I became a Linux distro developer and package maintainer.
I volunteered on Funtoo Linux in the beginning, troubleshooting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Robbins_(computer_programmer)][Daniel Robbin's]] new distro, [[https://www.funtoo.org/Welcome][Funtoo Linux]], and writing
technical documentation like this [[https://www.funtoo.org/Libvirt][Libvirt wiki page.]] Drobbins is the creator of [[https://www.gentoo.org/][Gentoo Linux]]-- you may have heard of it.


*** Creating a NixOS installer
I went on a brief stint with [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]], where with the oversight of [[https://github.com/dustinlacewell][Dustin Lacewell aka ldlework,]] (my only Silicon Valley friend in tech),
I built my own [[https://github.com/a-schaefers/themelios][zfs-on-root installer called Themelios]] which still enjoys some usage to this day.
NixOS is interesting, I'll just say that-- and I respect the work they're doing, along with [[https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/][Guix]], but I've come to prefer
a simpler approach that is [[https://sta.li/][Stali Linux]] and [[https://github.com/oasislinux/oasis][OASIS]]. While I understand the problems solved by dynamic linking and the attempt to
resolve the accompanying dependency hell issues in the [[https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/nspfssd-lisa2004-final.pdf][nix whitepapers,]] I tend to prefer instead the simpler solution of static linking,
as disk space is no longer expensive.

*** Becoming a Linux distro dev and package maintainer
After that I distro hopped on over to [[https://kisslinux.org/][KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) Linux]] where I worked with [[https://github.com/dylanaraps][Dylan Araps]], author of [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch][Neofetch]]. This distro is amazing,
and only uses some odd 30 Megabytes of RAM.
Dylan became another one of my all-time great mentors. I am the [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/community/graphs/contributors][number two all-time committer]] on the classic community repo,
as I was maintaining the [[https://suckless.org/][suckless]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html][GNU stacks]]. One time I fixed a bug in a package written in C, and submitted a patch [[https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206741][where it officially was merged]]
at [[https://kernel.org/][Kernel.org]]. I also did some work on the KISS init scripts and a lot of testing for the package manager.
I'll never forget the day I left the project, and [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/community/issues/1165][released my packages that I was maintaining back to the KISS community.]] I made that
decision as I was nearing getting married in 2020, and I was also working in a paid capacity.

*** Writing my own init scripts
Around this time also, I wrote my own Linux init scripts using the Emacs Lisp programming language, dubbed [[https://github.com/a-schaefers/systemE]["SystemE"]] by a friend on IRC (trolling systemd) and I hit
the [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22120510][Hacker News Top 10]] for a day, and I was pretty jazzed about that.

*** Creating my own Emacs distro and more
During this phase I really felt like I had graduated. Tools like ~ssh~, ~gpg~, ~find~, ~grep~, ~git~, ~patch~ and ~diff~ would now be second nature.
I built my own [[https://github.com/a-schaefers/spartan-emacs][Emacs framework called "Spartan Emacs"]]. I knew POSIX shell and Bash,
Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp; some C, Ruby and Python. I was finally a software developer and it was time for a job.

Beyond this, I learned a lot about ~PATH~ and ~ENVIRONMENT~ in Linux, and that [[https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/series/unix-as-ide/][Unix can be your IDE.]] Here's some classic books on the subject,
[[https://www.amazon.com/Unix-Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/013937681X][The Unix Programming Environment]] and [[https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628][C Programming Language]] by K&R.

Open source software experience is the best and it makes me who I am. This experience, to this day, is more valuable to me than anything I have ever done in paid capacity.

* Devops consulting, 2020 -- 2021 (Remote worker extraordinaire)

[[./assets/images/ET-blogpost-remoteworker-May15.png]]

In 2020 I ran my own Devops consulting business, mainly maintaining servers and providing traditional system administration services for large non profits.

I collaborated with many other developers during this time. We used Mattermost (slack clone), Redmine, Google Calendar, and various video software communication platforms for communication means.

My primary respnsibilties were as follows:

+ Find, report and fix bugs
+ Collaborate with a team using version control
+ Documentation writing
+ Implement an effective CI/CD pipeline
+ Evaluate various DevOps solutions and make recommendations
+ Migrate and deploy large Drupal and Civicrm websites
+ Monitor and maintain public and private dev, staging and production servers
+ Monitor and maintain high volume mail servers
+ Research performance optimization issues
+ Assist devs and project managers to better serve our clients

It was here where I learned the ability to utilize Redmine effectively and how to communicate professionally with my peers,
something that is some-what lacking in the Open Source world.

* Senior Devops at Immaculata Studios, 2021 -- Present (Automation life)
[[./assets/images/terra_aws.png]]


About a year ago I joined up with [[https://www.immaculatastudios.com/][Immaculata Studios]] as their Senior DevOps Engineer.
I'm here to scale the team and products primarily using Terraform with AWS infrastructure and Docker microservices.
I can't say too much, but there's a lot cooking right now.
In the future I hope to expand this site with various blogs regarding projects I'm working on.

Recently, I obtained my Terraform Associate Certificate. It wasn't difficult to pass the exam, given how much I use Terraform on a daily basis.

The AWS Certified Devops Engineer certificate will be next.

* Back to college, 2022 -- Present (Part-time work on my degree...)
[[./assets/images/uopeople.png]]
I've always found University to be cost prohibitive, opting not to rack up debt and learn for free on the internet instead.

However, I'm now enrolled in
https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/online-bachelors/computer-science/
where I do hope to finally get the CS piece of paper that I've always wanted.
