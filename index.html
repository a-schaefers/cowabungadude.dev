My first computer was one of these, pre-loaded by dad with a boat load of cracked games, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT6bVDxOs3k">"Hopper."</a>
</p>

<p>
This box was the mystery of my childhood&#x2013; I knew it had potential to do really cool things, if only I could connect to the internet.
</p>

<p>
There was always some odd file that I would find on the system and then I would try to figure out if it was a program that I could execute.
</p>

<p>
I learned DOS commands and batch scripts early on in this way, before GUI's were much of a thing.
</p>

<p>
I was running my own WAMP stacks and messing around with frameworks like "Php Nuke", "PhpBB" and exploring Geocities in Junior High. This was all mostly to make cool websites for my video game "clans."

I graduated High School in 2006.
I was homeschooled before it was the cool thing to do. <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> My parents were very forward-thinking in this regard.
</p>

<p>
My father taught me that if you want something done right, then you need to do it yourself.
</p>

<p>
This comes in to play later on when I realized out that I could learn anything I wanted on the internet&#x2013;
that the original hacker spirit is the Unix Philosophy <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> with DIY ethos. <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>

<p>
I dropped out of college early on, not having a high regard for the system <sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> at the time.
I traveled and read a lot of books on Philosophy, History, Theology and English &#x2013; as any millennial should.
</p>

<p>
I landed in Honolulu, Hawaii.
There I worked as a Valet Driver, Bellman, Doorman in some of the nicest Hotels and Restaurants on the Waikiki strip.

<p>
A few years back I found a random photograph of myself (see above) while googling one of old my hotels.
</p>

<p>
While not malevolent&#x2013; little did I know at the time&#x2013; that I was receiving a free education in social engineering.
The name of the game was called "Did he (<i>or she</i>) tip you?" and we knew how to get tipped&#x2013; unwittingly by hacking people.
Like any good flick on HBO Max, the illusion was wealth and the key was social discourse.
These skills would be invaluable later while working in tech as a white hat.
</p>

<p>
In this way, I have always been a "hacker."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
What does hacking and work in the service industry have in common? Playful cleverness.
In "Did he (<i>or she</i>) tip you 101, we quickly learn that to get tips, we have to have fun the guests.

<p>
Similarly put by an O.G. hacker,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I went to lunch with some GNU fans, and was sitting down to eat some tteokbokki (*), when a waitress set down six chopsticks right in front of me.
It occurred to me that perhaps these were meant for three people, but it was more amusing to imagine that I was supposed to use all six.
I did not know any way to do that, so I realized that if I could come up with a way, it would be a hack. I started thinking. After a few seconds I had an idea.
</p>

<p>
First I used my left hand to put three chopsticks into my right hand.
That was not so hard, though I had to figure out where to put them so that I could control them individually. Then I used my right hand to put the other three chopsticks into my left hand. That was hard, since I had to keep the three chopsticks already in my right hand from falling out. After a couple of tries I got it done.

<p>
One day I looked up from my hotel with my Bellman standing next to me, and we noticed the glint of a scope from a far-off hotel room flashing at us.
</p>

<p>
Somebody was watching us. Nothing ever came of it, but we found it very odd at the time.
</p>

<p>
Also around that time Snowden <sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> was revealing to the citizens of the United States that the government was illegally spying on all of us.
</p>

<p>
Since I always had a natural <i>aptitude</i> for computing&#x2013; after all my first Linux distro was Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron ~2008&#x2013;
I found all this was very interesting to think about.
When Snowden revealed that smartphones were backdoored by the NSA, among other things, it reignited something in me.
</p>

<p>
Around this time I found renewed joy in computing, and the cypher-punk feels of Linux. In those days one would have found me growing out my neckbeard whilst reverse SSH tunneling 10 servers deep before connecting to the
TOR network (and every other privacy-centric network I could find.)
I soon joined various IRC channels, where we would discuss merits of various Linux distros and open-source software for hours.
It was just a hobby at first&#x2013; that is, privacy and security research&#x2013; I hadn't the slightest where this would all lead.
</p>

<p>
I soon found myself moving back to Oregon, where I was born raised. I told my parents at the time, "There's something good here, I'm learning a lot.
I will be doing this for a living soon enough, but there's a lot to learn first&#x2026;"
</p>

<p>
I started watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BryanLunduke/videos">The Lunduke Show</a>. I went to <i>YouTube University</i>, catching every <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/tutoriaLinux/videos">TutoriaLinux (Dave Cohen)</a> episode I could &#x2013;
I sent him a thank you Email years later along the lines, "Hey, thanks for sharing your knowledge and helping me to get grounded in the industry." He replied back, too.
Dave's a champ.
</p>

<p>
Admittedly, I used to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3iy3wd/stupid_question_what_is_ricing/">rice</a> my desktop back then. I used VIM like a pleb<sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> and apparently <a href="https://github.com/a-schaefers/i3-wm-gruvbox-theme">people still like work in that regard</a>.

<p>
In a world where things are so often out of our control, the fact that we can program computers do exactly what we want is a strange comfort, and we shared this in common.

<p>
We met once a month or so and ordered pizza, with prolonged Emacs hacking sessions and candid discussions on the state of the industry, jobs and
open source software.

<h3 id="sec-1-8"><span class="section-number-3">1.8</span> The bootcamp years and Imposter Syndrome</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
Imposter Syndrome is a funny thing. When you're feeling impostery you know that, "I'm good enough to be here and do this job."
But you don't feel that way on the inside.
I felt like I had something to prove, and that I needed to be the best before I entered the field full-time in a paid atmosphere.
I suspect it stems from the ever-changing, ever-learning nature of tech.
I recommend you accept that and forget about it. There's nothing wrong with you dude, you're fine!
I spent several years in this hell, I built the place! I don't regret it, but I also don't recommend it.
</p>

<p>
At the time, I was on the computer 12 hours every day, studying.
I installed Arch Linux a hundred times, I nigh memorized the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide">now infamous wiki</a> &#x2013;
FreeBSD, the same&#x2013; and I actually read <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/">the Handbook.</a>
I learned the ins-and-outs of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>: <code>Route53</code>, <code>S3</code>, <code>EC2</code>, <code>Cloudfront</code> and more.
I settled on a text editor, <code>emacs</code> and started to form my own opinions on things.
</p>

<p>
I had another mentor during this period of my life, <a href="https://github.com/TemptorSent">Chris Giorgi</a> of #gentoo / #funtoo on Freenode, he was an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AWK-Programming-Language-Alfred-Aho/dp/020107981X">awk-programmer extraordinaire</a>.
He taught me how to use <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/">ZFS</a>. He taught me that there are shell scripts and then there are <i>shell scripts</i>.
Finally, somebody more paranoid than I was, he sanity checked and validated <i>every</i> input variable.
</p>

<p>
Here's a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork bomb</a>,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">evil () {
  evil|evil &amp;
}
evil
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Better yet, as we all love good one-liner,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">:(){ :|:&amp; };:
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Put that in your Terminal and smoke it!
</p>

<p>
Corny jokes aside, I learned POSIX shell script and system administration here in this phase, which leads in to the Devops path now-a-days.
</p>

<p>
Programmers need to use the Terminal and know some bash, but when you're working on an embedded system with limited disk space and ram, you're probably not
going to have Bash, and your <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism">bashisms</a> are going to fail you. But shell is there, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX is still KING</a>. Chris taught me
POSIX shell&#x2013; it's a dying art and I'm glad to carry this tradition.

During this time I became a Linux distro developer and package maintainer.
I volunteered on Funtoo Linux in the beginning, troubleshooting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Robbins_(computer_programmer)">Daniel Robbin's</a> new distro, <a href="https://www.funtoo.org/Welcome">Funtoo Linux</a>, and writing
technical documentation like this <a href="https://www.funtoo.org/Libvirt">Libvirt wiki page.</a> Drobbins is the creator of <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a>&#x2013; you may have heard of it.
</p>

<p>
I went on a brief stint with <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, where with the oversight of <a href="https://github.com/dustinlacewell">Dustin Lacewell aka ldlework,</a> (my only Silicon Valley friend in tech),
I built my own <a href="https://github.com/a-schaefers/themelios">zfs-on-root installer called Themelios</a> which still enjoys some usage to this day.
NixOS is interesting, I'll just say that&#x2013; and I respect the work they're doing, along with <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/">Guix</a>, but I've come to prefer
a simpler approach that is <a href="https://sta.li/">Stali Linux</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oasislinux/oasis">OASIS</a>. While I understand the problems solved by dynamic linking and the attempt to
resolve the accompanying dependency hell issues in the the <a href="https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/nspfssd-lisa2004-final.pdf">nix whitepapers,</a> I tend to prefer instead the simpler solution of static linking,
as disk space is no longer expensive.
</p>

<p>
After that I distro hopped on over to <a href="https://kisslinux.org/">KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) Linux</a> where I worked with <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps">Dylan Araps</a>, author of <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch">Neofetch</a>. This distro is amazing,
and only uses some odd 30 Megabytes of RAM.
Dylan became another one of my all-time great mentors. I am the <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/community/graphs/contributors">number two all-time committer</a> on the classic community repo,
as I was maintaining the <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html">GNU stacks</a>. One time I fixed a bug in a package written in C, and submitted a patch <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206741">where it officially was merged</a>
at <a href="https://kernel.org/">Kernel.org</a>. I also did some work on the KISS init scripts and a lot of testing for the package manager.
I'll never forget the day I left the project, and <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/community/issues/1165">released my packages that I was maintaining back to the KISS community.</a> I made that
decision as I was nearing getting married in 2020, and I was also finally working in a paid capacity.
</p>

<p>
During this phase I really felt like I had graduated. Tools like <code>find</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>patch</code> and <code>diff</code> would now be second nature. I built my own <a href="https://github.com/a-schaefers/spartan-emacs">Emacs framework called "Spartan Emacs"</a>. I knew POSIX shell and Bash,
Lisp, some C, Ruby and Python. I was finally a software developer and it was time for a job.
</p>

<p>
Open source software experience is the best and it makes me who I am. This experience, to this day, is more valuable than anything I have ever done in paid capacity.
</p>

<p>
Beyond this, I learned a lot about <code>PATH</code> and <code>ENVIRONMENT</code> in Linux, and that <a href="https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/series/unix-as-ide/">Unix can be your IDE.</a> Here's some classic books on the subject,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unix-Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/013937681X">The Unix Programming Environment</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628">C Programming Language</a> by K&amp;R.
